# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NIA (AI Assistant) CRM Meeting Intelligence system is a specialized platform that automates meeting-related CRM workflows through intelligent calendar integration, automated debriefing, and smart data extraction. The system integrates with Creatio CRM to provide bidirectional synchronization, intelligent meeting detection, automated post-meeting debriefing sessions, and structured data extraction from conversations. Built with Django backend and featuring a CRM-style frontend, NIA leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide context-aware questioning, conversation parsing, and intelligent CRM updates.
