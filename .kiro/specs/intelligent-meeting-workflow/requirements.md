# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NIA (AI Meeting Assistant) is an MVP meeting intelligence platform that focuses on the core validation loop: AI joins video calls as a silent listener, generates draft summaries, conducts post-call validation sessions with sales reps, and only updates CRM after human approval. The system integrates with Google Meet/Teams/Zoom for call participation, supports multiple CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Creatio), and uses n8n workflows for post-validation automation. The platform aims to ensure 100% accuracy in CRM updates through human validation while automating the transcription and initial processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Video Call Integration and Transcription

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want NIA to join my video calls as a silent participant and provide real-time transcription, so that I can focus on the conversation while having accurate meeting records generated automatically.

2. WHEN NIA joins a call THEN the system SHALL begin real-time transcription with speaker identification
3. WHEN transcription is active THEN the system SHALL capture conversation content without disrupting the meeting
4. WHEN the call ends THEN NIA SHALL generate a draft summary with key points and action items
5. WHEN technical issues occur THEN NIA SHALL handle connection failures gracefully and retry joining
6. WHEN privacy is required THEN NIA SHALL only join calls where all participants have consented

### Requirement 2: Post-Call Validation Session

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want NIA to schedule a quick validation session after each call to review and confirm the AI-generated summary, so that I can ensure accuracy before any CRM updates are made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call ends THEN NIA SHALL automatically schedule an "Update Meeting" session with the sales rep
2. WHEN the validation session starts THEN NIA SHALL present the draft summary and ask confirmation questions
3. WHEN reviewing content THEN the system SHALL ask "Is this summary correct?" and allow edits
4. WHEN discussing next steps THEN NIA SHALL ask "What's the next step and timeline?" and capture responses
5. WHEN updating deal status THEN NIA SHALL ask "Should I update stage to [suggested stage]?" and get approval
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL only proceed with CRM updates after explicit rep approval

### Requirement 3: Multi-CRM Integration and Updates

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want NIA to update my CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, or Creatio) with validated meeting outcomes, so that my pipeline data stays current without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation session is approved THEN NIA SHALL update the appropriate CRM system with meeting outcomes
2. WHEN updating CRM THEN the system SHALL support Salesforce, HubSpot, and Creatio APIs
3. WHEN formatting data THEN NIA SHALL structure meeting notes appropriately for each CRM's field requirements
4. WHEN creating records THEN the system SHALL update opportunity stages, add notes, and create follow-up tasks
5. WHEN sync completes THEN NIA SHALL confirm successful CRM updates to the sales rep
6. IF CRM updates fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and notify the rep of any failures

### Requirement 4: Automated Follow-up and Workflow Triggers

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want NIA to automatically draft follow-up emails and trigger relevant workflows after validated meetings, so that I can maintain momentum without manual administrative tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN emails are drafted THEN the system SHALL ask rep approval before sending any communications
3. WHEN workflows are triggered THEN NIA SHALL use n8n to post summaries to Slack/Teams channels
4. WHEN tasks are needed THEN the system SHALL create action items in project management tools
5. WHEN calendar events are required THEN NIA SHALL draft meeting invites for next steps
6. WHEN all workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all automated actions taken

### Requirement 5: Dashboard and Transcript Management

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want a dashboard that shows both raw AI transcripts and validated final versions with CRM sync status, so that I can track the validation process and ensure data accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all meetings with raw vs. confirmed transcript status
2. WHEN viewing meeting details THEN the system SHALL show draft summaries alongside validated final versions
3. WHEN checking sync status THEN the dashboard SHALL display CRM update status for each meeting
4. WHEN validation is pending THEN the system SHALL highlight meetings requiring rep review
5. WHEN searching transcripts THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search across all meeting content
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow download of validated transcripts and summaries

### Requirement 6: Video Call Bot Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want NIA to reliably join video calls across different platforms, so that the transcription service works consistently for all sales meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with video platforms THEN NIA SHALL support Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom

4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN calls end unexpectedly THEN NIA SHALL detect disconnection and save partial transcripts
6. WHEN multiple calls occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent call participation

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure handling of sensitive meeting data and CRM information, so that customer privacy and company data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing meeting audio THEN the system SHALL encrypt all transcription data in transit and at rest
2. WHEN storing CRM credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure credential management for API access

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transcriptions THEN the system SHALL maintain 99% uptime during business hours
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN AI processing SHALL complete within 30 seconds of call completion
3. WHEN validating with reps THEN the validation session SHALL be available within 2 minutes of call end
