Final Reminder: Complete Debriefing for {{ meeting.title }}

Hi {{ user.first_name|default:user.username }},

LAST CHANCE: This is your final reminder to complete the debriefing for the meeting below. After this, the session will be marked as skipped.

Meeting: {{ meeting.title }}
Date: {{ meeting.start_time|date:"F j, Y" }}
Time: {{ meeting.start_time|time:"g:i A" }} - {{ meeting.end_time|time:"g:i A" }}
Originally Scheduled: {{ session.scheduled_time|date:"F j, Y g:i A" }}

We understand you're busy, so we're offering two options:

1. Complete Full Debriefing: {{ debriefing_url }}
2. Take 2-Minute Survey: {{ quick_survey_url }}

Quick Survey Option:
Short on time? Our 2-minute survey captures the essential meeting outcomes:
- Meeting outcome rating
- Key next steps
- Follow-up requirements
- Basic insights

While not as comprehensive as the full debriefing, it ensures critical information isn't lost.

What happens if you don't respond?
If no action is taken, this debriefing will be marked as skipped, and you'll receive a quick survey link as a final opportunity to capture basic meeting information.
